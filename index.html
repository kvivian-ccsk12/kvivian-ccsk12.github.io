                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Slow and fragile, but absolutely must be protected.</li>
                        <li>It's the only piece that you <em>cannot</em> let be captured.</li>
                        <li>It starts to be much more useful toward the end of the game.</li>
                    </ul></section>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>You cannot 'save' your first move boost. Use it or lose it!</li>
                        <li>Pawns are the only piece that captures different than it moves.</li>
                        <li>Pawns like to be together, protecting one another.</li>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Knights are the only ones who can jump over other pieces (like a horse).</li>
                        <li>Knights flip the colored square they are on each move.</li>
                        <li>Knights are best in the middle of the board where they can control the most squares.</li>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Bishops move diagonally as far as they want (but not over things). This keeps them on the same color.</li>
                        <li>Placing Bishops in the center makes more use of them, but it can also be good to put them in a corner to 'snipe' your opponent.</li>
                        <li>You have two bishops to control both colored squares. Try and keep them or you have less control of <em>half</em> the board!</li>
                    </ul></section>

                    <section><h2>The Rook</h2><p>The tower of power</p></section>
                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Rooks move in straight lines as far as they want.</li>
                        <li>Rooks like looking at each other to double their power and protect each other.</li>
                        <li>Rooks take a while to come to the battle, but are <em>very</em> powerful toward the end of the game.</li>

                    <section><h2>The Queen</h2><p>The almighty piece</p></section>
                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>The Queen moves like a rook and a bishop combined.</li>
                        <li>The Queen is your most powerful piece. If you lose it the game will be very difficult to win.</li>
                        <li>The Queen is a team player; it really likes working with the other pieces to attack the opponent.</li>

                    <section><h3>Rules of Check</h3><ul>
                        <li>If you are in check, you <strong>must</strong> get out of check.</li>
                        <li>You cannot put yourself into check.</li>
                        <li>If you put your opponent in check, quietly and politely tell them they are in check.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The last one isn't an official rule, but we will be doing it in this camp to help us learn.</p></section>
                    <section><h3>Getting out of Check</h3><ol>
                        <li>Capturing the checking piece.</li>

                        <li>"White on the right" - The bottom right square should be a light square.</li>
                        <li>"King on the opposite color" - White King will go on a dark square, Black King on a light square.</li>
                        <li>Bishop is almost royal - Put the bishops next to the King and Queen.</li>
