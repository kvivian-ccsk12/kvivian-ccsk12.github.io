                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Slow and fragile, but absolutely must be protected.</li>
                        <li>It's the only piece that you <em>cannot</em> let be captured.</li>
                        <li>It starts to be much more useful toward the end of the game.</li>
                    </ul></section>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>You cannot 'save' your first move boost. Use it or lose it!</li>
                        <li>Pawns are the only piece that captures different than it moves.</li>
                        <li>Pawns like to be together, protecting one another.</li>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Knights are the only ones who can jump over other pieces (like a horse).</li>
                        <li>Knights flip the colored square they are on each move.</li>
                        <li>Knights are best in the middle of the board where they can control the most squares.</li>
                    </ul></section>

                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Bishops move diagonally as far as they want (but not over things). This keeps them on the same color.</li>
                        <li>Placing Bishops in the center makes more use of them, but it can also be good to put them in a corner to 'snipe' your opponent.</li>
                        <li>You have two bishops to control both colored squares. Try and keep them or you have less control of <em>half</em> the board!</li>
                    </ul></section>

                    <section><h2>The Rook</h2><p>The tower of power</p></section>
                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>Rooks move in straight lines as far as they want.</li>
                        <li>Rooks like looking at each other to double their power and protect each other.</li>
                        <li>Rooks take a while to come to the battle, but are <em>very</em> powerful toward the end of the game.</li>

                    <section><h2>The Queen</h2><p>The almighty piece</p></section>
                    <section><h3>Notes:</h3><ul>
                        <li>The Queen moves like a rook and a bishop combined.</li>
                        <li>The Queen is your most powerful piece. If you lose it the game will be very difficult to win.</li>
                        <li>The Queen is a team player; it really likes working with the other pieces to attack the opponent.</li>
